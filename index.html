        <h1>Adopt-a-Cell Program</h1>
        <p>USC Solar Car is currently working on a solar-powered car to compete in Australia.</p>
        <p>We invite you to adopt one of the solar cells that will power our new car. The cost to adopt a cell is $25, but all donations are appreciated.</p>
        <p>Adopting a cell is a great way to become more involved with the team, and it will be tax deductible.</p>
